## PfarreTobelbad.at ⛪

[https://www.pfarretobelbad.at](https://www.pfarretobelbad.at) was a website that was created as an obligatory project at High School at the HAK Grazbachgasse in 2011 together with my colleagues Christian Bagari and Stefan Haberlandt.

The main goal was to create a website for the Parish Office Tobelbad in Hasensdorf-Tobelbad/Styria/Austria so they could publish information, pictures, and other content on their site. 📸📝

Additionally, we created a video about their employees and one about the history of the Parish Office Tobelbad. Both videos are available on their website.

The website has since been reprogrammed and is now maintained by the Parish Office Tobelbad IT team.

## Massage-Karner.at 💆‍♂️

[https://www.massage-karner.at](https://www.massage-karner.at) is the private website of the lay pastor of the Parish Office Tobelbad. He has a massage parlor besides his work for the parish office. This website has been available since 09/2012. 📅

## Hardwarelabor 🔧

The "Hardwarelabor" was a room in the cellar of our school and the name for a voluntary subject, created by one of our teachers.

At my time, MMag. Verena Seiner and Mag. Kristian Trubelja were responsible for this subject. 👩‍🏫👨‍🏫

### What was the subject about?

Together with our teachers, we maintained and repaired the IT infrastructure of our school including, for example:

- Maintaining, cleaning, and connecting video projectors 🎥
- Repairing PCs in the classrooms and computer rooms 🖥️
- Repairing and installing printers in the classrooms and computer rooms 🖨️
- Installing PCs based on a WDS-Image 💾
- Getting "difficult programs" running 🛠️
- Support for the IT system in our banquet hall 🏛️

## VirtualSchool.at 🏫

[https://www.virtualschool.at](https://www.virtualschool.at) is a complete virtualization infrastructure solution based on Hyper-V.

I help Mag. Georg Steingruber to install several schools in and around Graz including:
